# HIIT Timer for high intensity interval training

This program is used to control a HIIT stopwatch. In high-intensity interval training, there is always an active phase in which an exercise is performed and a relaxation phase until the next exercise.

A specific duration can be set for each of the two phases. After starting the clock (long press), the set time intervals are counted down alternately. When a countdown reaches zero, an acoustic signal sounds and the next countdown begins.

A rotary encoder is used to enter the values and control the clock. The output device is a 128x64 pixel OLED display.  

If no input is made at the clock, the circuit is put into a sleep mode to save power. The power consumption in sleep mode is about < 10ÂµA. To end this, a short press on the encoder button is also sufficient.

This version is customized to an ATtiny 1614. A crystal is connected to the Attiny 1614 so that the time function is more accurate.
